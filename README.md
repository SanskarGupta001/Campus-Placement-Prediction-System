## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict campus placement outcomes.

The system takes academic, skill-based, and profile-based inputs from the user and provides:

- ✅ Placement Prediction (Placed / Not Placed)
- 📊 Confidence Score (Probability)
- 🖥️ Interactive GUI Application
